# Minimalistic React Multiviews component

_Estimated duration: 2 hours (for Experienced React dev)_

Your task is to build a reusable React component following the best practices and idioms.

The component should work exactly like below:

```
<Multiviews
  onSelect={function(e) {}}
  defaultView="view2"
  views={{
    view1: {
      name: 'First View',
      view: () => (<div>This is the content of the first subview</div>)
    },
    view2: {
      name: 'Second view',
      view: () => (<div>This is the content of the second subview</div>)
    },
    views3: ...
  }}
/>
```

* The component should render a view where one subview is displayed, and provide buttons to switch from a view to another.
* The component should render defaultView at boot.
* onSelect should be triggered when the user changes the selected view.

## Rules

* Use the best practices and react idioms - no jQuery !
* Build an example application with the wizard component, this is to exemplify re-usability of the component and can serve as developer documentation
* Use Webpack to transpile your code and bundle your React application
* The example application should be working "out-of-the-box". Make sure your dependencies are in the package.json file and that the application compiles and runs correctly.
* Add a README file explaining how to launch the example app. It should be as simple as possible.

## What we follow

* Understanding the requirements and implement them as expected
* Good understanding of react component architecture
* Awareness of UI design patterns
* Clean, Reusable & Testable code
* Clean Git commits and history (We want to see the evolution of your code)

## Tech stack

* **React** (obviously), **npm** or **yarn**, **ES6**, **webpack**, **babel** (Feel free to use **react-start-app**)
* If you test your component, use **jest**
* If you lint your code, use the airbnb standard (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

_Even if you do not know **ES6**, this should not scare you, it is easy to pick up, considering previous JavaScript experience!_

## What we consider a plus

* Good architecture
* Good code quality (consider **eslint**)
* Tested component (Unit tests)
* Good documentation (imagine you are going to open source this component)
* Usage and emphasis on well established UI design patterns
* Any other feature you find interesting to add !
